# Blackout beta testing will soon be live

This page is for my alpha testers. Thank you so much for your time and effort playing the alpha version of *Blackout*. I carefully considered all of the feedback you gave me. I tried to implement every suggestion, whenever it was narratively and programmatically feasible.

Here is a link to the current beta version of the game: <a href="../Blackout.html" target="_blank">Blackout (beta version)</a>

Here is a link to the original version 1.0 that you tested: <a href="../blackout-alpha.html" target="_blank">Blackout (alpha version)</a>

For a complete list of changes between version 1.0 and version 2.0 (the first beta release) see the change log below.
