# My thoughts

* add a way to access the version number in game
* "myself" glitch likely caused by cache issues, should be resolved after migrating to github

# Jordan

* Reached the true end on first playthrough in 15 minutes, never used header
* The description links somehow confused him (need to talk to him about this in person to better understand)
* Liked the simplicity of the font and layout, and the subtle foreshadowing
* After the Russian calls Natasha, he didn't feel like he had a good choice. (He hadn't found the cocaine.) He wanted to run away instead. He didn't understand the microchip choice. He didn't know if he would be lying or not (never read the bio).
    - consider working in Hewlett-Packard into the mainline, and also into the bar flashback scene at the end.
* saw "myself" instead of "yourself"

# FRJ

* How can protag reach handcuff keys when hands are cuffed behind his back?
* He aggravated his foot injury when jumping to the forklifts, even though he never hurt his foot.
* Was initially confused with how "save" works.
* Some of the woman’s dialogue seemed like she embraced the protagonist’s delusion.
* also saw "myself" instead of "yourself"
